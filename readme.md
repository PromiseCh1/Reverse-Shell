# 🔁 Reverse Shell & Persistence Toolkit

> A stealthy, persistent C2 framework for Windows – built for red‑team exercises and cybersecurity education.  
> Provides remote shell, screen streaming, WiFi control, network blocking, DNS flush, and keylogging – with multi‑layer persistence and evasion.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Attacker** – Python 3.6+, OpenCV & NumPy  
  `sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-numpy`
- **Victim** – Windows 10/11, PowerShell (admin recommended)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Attacker (Kali)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Reverse-Shell.git
cd Reverse-Shell
python3 listener/listener.py
```

### 2. Victim (Windows)
- Copy `payload.ps1` and `install.cmd` to victim.
- **Run `install.cmd` as Administrator**.
- The payload installs persistence and connects immediately.

---

## 💻 Usage

Listener menu:

```
  1. Shell
  2. Single Screenshot
  3. Screen Stream (loop)
  4. WiFi Control
  5. Block Internet
  6. Unblock Internet
  7. DNS Flush
  8. Exit
```

Or type commands directly in the shell.
